				  	<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>In fall 2014, the MICA undergraduate graphic design blog needed a re-design, and the co-chair of the MICA Graphic Design undergraduate department (i.e., client) tasked several students me with re-designing the site. The blog had distracting visuals and needed streamlined content. Subsequently, I created a WordPress theme for the blog.</p>
				  	
				  	<h2 id="Research">Research</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>The redesign began with research that included a content audit, interviews of users, and a competitive analysis. Users agreed that the while it was good to have a blog and a site with department updates, the site was not very user-friendly and did not give users full access to the site's resources. Specifically, users disliked the text "GRAPHIC DESIGN" with a fixed position on the screen, and the hover effects were equally invasive.</p>
				  	<p>Incorporating the users' needs and feedback as well as the client's guidelines, I began sketching and designing the site as needed. My process began with sketches and progressed with a creative brief in addition to a style tile. Wanting the site to have a friendly tone, I leveraged a color palette of purples and light blues and also used web-friendly typefaces like Roboto Slab and Oxygen, courtesy of Google Fonts.</p>
				  	
				  	<h2 id="Development">Development</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>The client provided the HTML for the blog with the expectation that I would code the CSS and JavaScript that would make the site more mobile-friendly. As I coded and developed the site, I did lots of experimentation, trying different layouts and backgrounds, in order to keep the content at the forefront and the "delight factor" in play.</p>
				  	<p>During the development phase, coding was especially difficult when I was developing the navigation bar. In addition, I was unsure where to put the submenu as well. In the end, I simplified my designs and followed through with the hierarchy of content.</p>
				  	<p>My files were part of a forked repository on GitHub, allowing for easy access to my code and keep a record of commits and changes to the code.</p>
				  	
				  	<h2 id="#Assistance">Guided Help</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>I also had some help from <a href="https://github.com/benkutil" target="_blank">Ben Kutil</a>, the professor who also gave this specific assignment and the template files from the client. In addition, I used the Flexslider plugin for the detail pages' image galleries. The wrapper background image is one of the many wonderful transparent images from Transparent Textures.</p>
				  	
				  	<h2 id="#Final">Results</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>The final theme included responsive CSS and JavaScript, a more subdued color palette, and an easier navigation structure. I named the theme "Purple Monster." Because users needed a more user-friendly site, I simplified the site with a two-column layout for the full screens and mostly a one-column layout for the mobile screens. To add to the "delight factor," I formatted the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the homepage.</p>
				  	
				  	<p>The project allowed me to expand my coding skills, and I was able to tap into CSS and JavaScript more. The biggest web design project yet, I coded over 1300+ lines of CSS.</p>
