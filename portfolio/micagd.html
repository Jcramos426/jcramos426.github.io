				  	<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>In fall 2014, the MICA undergraduate graphic design blog needed a re-design, and the co-chair of the MICA Graphic Design undergraduate department (i.e., client) tasked several students me with re-designing the site. The blog had distracting visuals and needed streamlined content. Subsequently, students were reluctant to use the site, and other students were unaware of such a site. As part of a web design class, I created a WordPress theme for the blog with the goals of improving the user experience by helping organize a new information architecture, simplify the layout, and enable mobile browsing.</p>

				  	<h2 id="Research">The User</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>The redesign began with research that included a content audit, interviews of users, and a competitive analysis. Users agreed that the while it was good to have a blog and a site with department updates, the site was not very user-friendly and did not give users full access to the site's resources. Specifically, users disliked the text "GRAPHIC DESIGN" with a fixed position on the screen, and the hover effects were equally invasive.</p>
				  	<p>The target audience included MICA graphic design students and faculty, specifically the undergraduate department. I interviewed both students and faculty to gauge the overall perception and success of the site with its target users. From my interviews, I found that not many used the website, and a few students who were new to the graphic design major did not know about the blog site at all. Thus, I created three personas: John Mica, Jane Mica, and Freddie Mica. All were graphic design majors, and each had the goal of seeing students' work, learning more about internships, and refining his abilities respectively.</p>

				  	<h2 id="Development">Exploration</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>Incorporating the users' needs and feedback as well as the client's guidelines, I began sketching and designing the site as needed. My process began with sketches and progressed with a creative brief in addition to style tiles. I explored different typefaces like Montserrat and Cooper Hewitt, but chose other typefaces. Wanting the site to have a friendly tone, I leveraged a color palette of purples and light blues and used web-friendly typefaces in the end like Roboto Slab and Oxygen, courtesy of Google Fonts.</p>

				  	<p>The client provided the HTML for the blog with the expectation that I would code the CSS and JavaScript that would make the site more mobile-friendly. As I coded and developed the site, I did lots of experimentation, trying layouts based on various mock-ups and style tiles, in order to keep the content at the forefront and the "delight factor" in play.</p>
				  	
				  	<p>During the development phase, coding was especially difficult when I was developing the navigation bar. In addition, I was unsure where to put the submenu as well. In the end, I simplified my designs and followed through with the hierarchy of content.</p>

				  	<h2 id="Final">Goals &amp; Results</h2>
				  	
				  	<p>In class, students and I agreed on the site's content, and because of the class discussions, I simplified the layout and created a more responsive design. Through the exploration and development phases, I attempted to create a more vibrant layout meant to entice the reader with the content. I also wanted to ensure easy navigation throughout the site.</p>

					<a href="../img/portfolio/micagd/micagd-gallery.png" title="Gallery" class="case-item case-half" type="image"><img src="../img/portfolio/micagd/micagd-gallery.png" class="case-image"></a>
					
				  	<p>The final theme included responsive CSS and JavaScript, a more subdued color palette, and an easier navigation structure. I named the theme "Purple Monster." Because users needed a more user-friendly site, I simplified the site with a two-column layout for the full screens and mostly a one-column layout for the mobile screens. To add to the "delight factor," I formatted the Spotify playlist at the bottom of the homepage. I customized the navigation bar as well and kept the less important content like the submenu at the bottom of the page.</p>
				  	
				  	<p>The project allowed me to expand my coding skills, and I was able to learn more about the best practices of CSS and JavaScript. The biggest web design project yet, I coded over 1300+ lines of CSS. With the theme complete, I learned that I can continue developing my skills with web typography, coding, and mock-ups.</p>
